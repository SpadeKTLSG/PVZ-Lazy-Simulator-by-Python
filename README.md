# PVZ-Lazy-Simulator-by-Python
My Python Class Homework done in 36 hours

Though I'm a greenhand in Pygame, also for Python, I accept a duel for create a Plants Vs Zombies Simulator for my class end homework...
So that's it, what a mess!

To read the code, tools or ability you need:
 
    1. Simplified Chinese ability
    2. Pygame basic knowlege (Very basic!)
    3. maybe IDE like Pycharm (I build it in version: 2023)
    4. Python v3.10 or above

Next, click the PVZ.py in main space, then enjoy it!
